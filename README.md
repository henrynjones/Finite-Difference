# Finite-Difference

This repository illustrates one implementation of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for the wave equation, 
the classic hyperbolic PDE. This implementation was done in conjunction with my final paper for MA 418 Numerical Analysis
tought by Dr. Jane McDougall and is based out of the text "Numerical Analysis" by Richard L. Burden, Douglas J. Faires, and 
Annette M. Burden. The implementation approximates an adapted version of problem 12.3.5 following along with algorithm 12.4 
in the text.
